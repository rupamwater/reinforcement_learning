## Reinforcment Learning Projects

This project lists the Reinfrocment learning agents developed using Q learning or Deep Q learning. The following are the project details

1. Power Controller - This is a reinforecement learning agent developed using Q learning using Open AI gym to simulate the agent. The agent gets the poer consumption from the consumer and available power from Solar Panel, Battery and Grid to optimise the usage of power. Highest reward is awarded to the agent for using power from Solar Panel followed by Battery and the a penalty for using power from Grid.
